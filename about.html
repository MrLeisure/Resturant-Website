                    <p><b>Lone Traveler Tavern Hours: Monday to Saturday: 7:45 AM to 3:30 PM.</b> Kitchen closes at 3 PM. If you are coming with a group of more than 6 people please make a reservation – 239-600-0966.</p>
                    <p>Level 13, 2 Elizabeth St, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia</p>
                    <p> <b>Lone Traveler Tavern</b> is an Australian style cafe that serves simple, natural food – including Vegan and Gluten Free options – accompanied by authentic espresso coffee. Most coffee shops in the United States don’t do much with food and most restaurants don’t worry about coffee. The Australian café is a hybrid combining a strong coffee culture and a robust food culture under one roof in a welcoming, cozy and comfortable neighborhood café.</p>
                    <p><b>Our Coffee </b>– We serve a range of espresso coffees made from the finest coffee beans, roasted right here in Cape Coral, and our baristas really know their beans. With their superior technical knowledge and a passion for making amazing coffee they will make you the perfect cuppa.</p>
                    <p><b>Our Food</b> – Our food is all natural, simple food made with local ingredients, wherever possible, to provide you with fresher, healthier and deliciously tasty meals. We have a well stocked pastry cabinet, our food has an international flavor and we offer gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options.</p>
                    <p><b>Lone Traveler Tavern Events & Private Functions</b> – We host monthly wine dinners, chefs’ tasting dinners and more. We also enjoy hosting your special occasions – whether baby showers, anniversaries, birthdays, or office parties. See our Fine Dining & Functions page for more details.</p>
                    <P><b>We also have a little attitude: Lone Traveler Tavern</b> has a cool, trendy shabby chic decor and an upbeat fun atmosphere with a whole lot of colorful idioms: brekkie (breakfast), avo (avocado), and “no worries” (you’re welcome).</P>
                    <p>It’s the perfect place to relax on your own or to catch up with friends while enjoying great coffee and great food.</p>
                    <p>Like in most Australian cafés one of our signature menu items is our “avocado smash”. Sometimes called an avocado toast, the perfect comfort food for any time of the day. We smash half a ripe avocado and some feta cheese onto a thick piece of toast (of your choice), season it with salt, pepper and chili flakes (optional), then give it a splash of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon.</p>
                    <p>In Australia, cafés play a central role in people’s lifestyle. Its where people hang out, where they meet up with friends and have business meetings; before work, after a morning swim or working out, for breakfast, for lunch, a snack or just a coffee.</p>
                    <p>We hope <b>Lone Traveler Tavern</b> will become part of your neighborhood and lifestyle.</p>
